/**
 * Loads this module's native library inside whatever process the module is in.
 *
 * <p>The library ships in the module's own APK, and the process that wants it is
 * a target application, not ours - so the usual route (the app's extracted
 * native library directory) does not exist for it. Two routes are tried:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Straight out of the module's APK, as {@code <apk>!/lib/<abi>/lib.so}.
 *       Android's linker understands that form and the APK's own file context is
 *       one an application may execute from, so nothing has to be written.</li>
 *   <li>Extracted into the target's cache directory and loaded from there. This
 *       is expected to fail on Android 10 and later, which refuses to execute
 *       code from an application's writable data directory; it is kept because
 *       the failure is worth seeing rather than assuming.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Whatever happened is kept in {@link #status()} - which route worked, or why
 * neither did. A native runtime that silently is not there would be the same
 * class of problem as the smali probe that silently listed nothing.
