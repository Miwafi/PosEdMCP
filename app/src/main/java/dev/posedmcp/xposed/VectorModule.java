/**
 * Module entry point for frameworks that speak the modern API, named in
 * {@code META-INF/xposed/java_init.list}.
 *
 * <p>The twin of {@link PosEdMcpModule}, and deliberately a thin one: it decides
 * nothing itself. It records the backend and hands the same class loader to the
 * same {@link SystemHooks} and {@link AppHost} the classic entry hands them, so
 * there is one implementation of what this module does and two ways of being
 * started.
 *
 * <p>Both package callbacks are implemented on purpose. They differ only in
 * which class loader they can offer — {@code onPackageLoaded} has the default
 * one, {@code onPackageReady} the one the app actually ended up with, after any
 * custom {@code AppComponentFactory} has had its say — and relying on just one
 * of them means doing nothing at all if the framework is older than we assumed.
 * {@link AppHost#install} is a one-shot per process, so whichever arrives first
 * wins and the second is a no-op.
 *
 * <p>Nothing throws out of these. A module that crashes the process it was
 * loaded into would be far more damaging than one that quietly does nothing.

     * The constructor an API-100 framework uses, and the reason this class can

     *
     * <p>Before 101 a module was handed the framework and the load parameters as
     * constructor arguments; from 101 on the framework constructs the module
     * with no arguments and calls {@code attachFramework()} and
     * {@code onModuleLoaded()} itself. Both spellings are here because both
     * frameworks are in circulation.
     *
     * <p>The older one does not check what we declare before reaching for this
     * constructor. Measured: LSPosed 1.10.2 is an API 100 framework, found this
     * class through {@code java_init.list}, died with
     * {@code NoSuchMethodException}, and did not fall back to the classic entry —
     * which left the module loaded nowhere at all, including on the device where
     * it had been working. Declaring {@code minApiVersion=101} did not stop it;
     * being constructible does.
     *
     * <p>Being built this way is also information: it means the framework
     * predates 101, and such a framework's mature, well-trodden API is the
     * classic one. So this route deliberately leaves {@link Framework} on its
     * classic default — the modern hook backend is for the frameworks whose
     * classic support is the thin part, which is exactly the ones that construct
     * modules the 101 way.
