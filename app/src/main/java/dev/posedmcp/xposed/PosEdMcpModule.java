/**

 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>System Framework</b> - {@link SystemHooks} runs inside system_server
 *       and provides screen capture, input injection, foreground tracking and
 *       screen-state events.</li>
 *   <li><b>any other scoped app</b> - {@link AppHost} runs inside that app's
 *       process and becomes a target for injected plugins.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Nothing throws out of the callbacks. A module that crashes the process it
 * was loaded into would be far more damaging than one that quietly does
 * nothing, so every failure is logged and swallowed.
